## How does Control flow   
The user flow starts with a successful login where their passwords are encrypted and stored. Then the shows that are available will be displayed where the user can pick the movie that he wishes to watch. Then he can choose the theatre he wishes to watch. After choosing the booking details like required seats, desired seat position, booking is confirmed. The user also has an option of searching the movie he wishes to watch.
On the other hand, TheatreOwners can log in with their credentials where they can view their theatres. The owners have an option of performing CRUD operations on theatre details. On selecting a particular theatre, the owner can view the shows (movies) in that theatre. Here the CRUD Operation can be performed on each show.
Both User and TheatreOwner have JWT Authentication, which has a validity of 1hr, after which it expires.
