# **üé¶ALGOMOX MULTIPLEX-THEATER BOOKING APPLICATION**

## Introduction

`Algomox_Multiplex_Booking` is a platform where users can book shows in different theatres available. It provides a good list of available movies to watch, where users can browse different movies. This gives the user great relief for those who wish to have quality time without any last-minute rushes and long waiting queues, as it makes booking pretty easy. Not only for users but also for owners who wish to update their theatre details with very few steps.

Below is the Entity Relationship diagram for my proposed system.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Application Flow   
The user flow starts with a successful `login` where their passwords are `encrypted` and stored. Then the shows that are available will be displayed where the user can pick the movie that he wishes to watch. Then he can choose the theatre he wishes to watch. After choosing the booking details like `required seats`, `desired seat position`, booking is confirmed. The user also had an option of searching the movie he wishes to watch.
On the other hand, TheatreOwners can log in with their credentials where they can view their theatres. The owners have an option of performing `CRUD` operations on theatre details. On selecting a particular theatre, the owner can view the shows (movies) in that theatre. Here the `CRUD` Operation can be performed on each show.
Both User and TheatreOwner have `JWT` Authentication, which is valid for `1hr`, after which it expires. 
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Program Structure
- The Project has following directories
   - `Controllers` : Contains files to handle requests.
   - `Database` : Contains database queries.
   - `Models` : Contains schema for each table.
   - `Routes` : Contains routing files to route the incoming requests based on url.
   - `Tokens` : Contains files for creating and verifying  `JWT` tokens.
- To ensure `reusability and modularity` I have created separate files for each tables.
- `database/databaseCreation.go` file contains queries for creating tables and key spaces.Table creation takes place only once.
-`database/databaseCreationCalling.go` file contains function for all the table creation queries.
- `main.go` start of the application
